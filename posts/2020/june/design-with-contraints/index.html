        <h1>Designing for brutalism</h1>
        <time>26.06.2020</time>
        <p>When designing personal projects, free from the restrictions of commercial work, I generally find myself (as, I imagine, do a lot of developers) building at the cutting edge of technology. The challenge is how far can we push? How much shiny new tech can I lever into this site? Can I have a WebGL header? How about a background made of canvas particles?</p>
<p>Working at the <a href="http://derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a>, even with our focus on making a highly accessible and functional site, I&rsquo;ve seen how a more modern web can lead to a more difficult web; how design and functionality can clash.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what could be done with the <em>minimum</em>, is it possible build a functional, elegant, site with, metaphorically, one hand tied behind my back?</p>
<p>With this in mind, I devised a set of hard rules that my new site <strong>must</strong> follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only two colours. Black and white</li>
<li>No JavaScript of any kind</li>
<li>No images</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial challenge was, given the extremely limited colour pallette, was creating a visual language to communicate intent and purpose. The key to this is consistency and simplicity and visual weight. Areas of the website are clearly differentiated and consistent. By reducing the number of possible interactions to the minimum, it means we can use a very simple system to indicate the purpose of interactive elements. In this case we are going back to basic web principles: any text with an underline is a link. I&rsquo;ve styled the links so that the underline is more pronounced, making links stand out more. With a lack of colour cues, adding clarity using weight like this is essential. Adding an external site visual indicator (â†—) helps understanding further.</p>
